            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
            and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
            written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
            very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
